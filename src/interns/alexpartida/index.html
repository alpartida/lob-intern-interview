      Hi ðŸ‘‹, all! I am an apparel production
      manager turned web developer. I just recently graduate a 6 month bootcamp
      and have also joined SheCodes for additional learning on web development.
      Super eager to get started in my transition into tech and really make an
      impact on my life and that of my daughters'. I am experienced in
      e-commerce with a demonstrated understanding of all things web. Skilled in
      WordPress, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Adobe Photoshop, and React. I've built a
      few apps, such as a weather app, dog api app, github-clone app, and many
      more. Follow me on <a href="https://github.com/alpartida">github</a>.
